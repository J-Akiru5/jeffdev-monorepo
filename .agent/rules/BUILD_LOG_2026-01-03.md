# 📝 Build Log Entry

**Date:** 2026-01-03  
**Context:** Documentation Standards Compliance  
**Decision:** Created CHANGELOG.md in `apps/prism-dashboard` per documentation standards  
**Rationale:** The documentation standards (`.agent/rules/documentation-standards.md`) specify that changelogs should be located in `apps/prism-dashboard/CHANGELOG.md`, but this file was missing. This ensures compliance with the "Living Document" law and proper tracking of Prism Dashboard changes.

## Changes Made

1. **Created `apps/prism-dashboard/CHANGELOG.md`**
   - Follows "Keep a Changelog" format
   - Includes [Unreleased] section for current changes
   - Documents version 0.1.0 (Genesis Release from 2026-01-01)
   - Structured according to documentation standards

## Notes

- The root `CHANGELOG.md` tracks monorepo-wide changes
- The dashboard-specific `CHANGELOG.md` tracks changes specific to the Prism Dashboard application
- This aligns with the documentation standards requirement for location-specific changelogs
