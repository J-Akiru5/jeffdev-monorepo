📈 JEFFDEV MONOREPO - BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE CONSTITUTION
1. THE "ALPHA FILTER" (OPPORTUNITY GATE)
Goal: We do not chase traffic. We chase "Alpha" Users (CTOs, Senior Engineers, Founders). Before initiating any task, the Agent must evaluate:

Is this "Sovereign"? Does this feature reinforce the user's ownership of their code, or does it feel like a cheap "lock-in" trick?

Reject: "One-click deploy to our proprietary cloud."

Accept: "One-click export to their own GitHub."

Does this solve "Context Entropy"? Does this feature save a senior developer from repeating themselves to an AI?

Is this "Dogfoodable"? Are we (JeffDev) actively using this feature to build our own agency? If we don't use it, we don't build it.

2. THE DUAL-ENGINE STRATEGY (TROJAN HORSE)
We operate two businesses that feed each other.

Engine A: The Agency (jeffdev.studio)
Role: The "Research Lab" & "Cash Cow."

Strategy: We take high-ticket custom projects to test Prism's capabilities.

The Pitch: "We don't just build your app; we install the Infrastructure so you can maintain it yourself."

Revenue Logic: Funds the R&D for Prism. 100% of Agency profit goes into Prism runway.

Engine B: The Product (prism.jeffdev.studio)
Role: The "Scale" & "Asset."

Strategy: "Context-as-a-Service." We sell the rules, not the hosting.

The Pitch: "Stop your AI from hallucinating. Deploy a Context Server that forces Cursor/Windsurf to follow your Design System."

Revenue Logic:

Phase 1 (Alpha): Free/Invite-Only for "Vibecoders" (to build the cult).

Phase 2 (Beta): $299/mo "Team Sync" Plan (Sync rules across 10+ devs).

3. CONVERSION ARCHITECTURE ("THE SOVEREIGN PROMISE")
Marketing to developers requires radical honesty, not hype.

The Narrative: "Website builders (Wix/Bolt) lock you in. Prism Engine locks you out—into your own clean, enterprise-grade repo."

The "Anti-Hype" Voice:

Never say: "Build apps in seconds!" (Sounds like a scam).

Say: "Orchestrate LLMs with strict architectural constraints." (Sounds like a tool for pros).

The CTA Strategy:

Agency: "Book a Systems Architecture Audit."

Prism: "Deploy Your Context Server."

4. TRUST & AUTHORITY PROTOCOLS
Identity: We are an Open Standards Partner.

We support MCP (Model Context Protocol).

We support Headless UI (Radix/Aria).

We support Open Source (The extension will be open).

Social Proof:

Do not use generic testimonials.

Use Case Studies with Metrics: "Reduced AI Hallucination Rate by 40% using Prism Rules."

5. MVP EXECUTION: THE "PARETO" CODE
The 80/20 Rule: We only build features that solve the "Blank Page Problem" for developers.

Hardcode First: If a feature (e.g., "User Profile Settings") is not essential for the core value proposition (Generating Rules), hardcode it or delay it.

Launch Criteria:

Agency: Must load in <500ms (Lighthouse 100).

Prism: Must successfully generate a valid .cursorrules file that works in VS Code. Nothing else matters.
