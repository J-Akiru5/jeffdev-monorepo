# Rule Management

Create, organize, and deploy context rules that guide your AI coding assistants.

Rules are the core of Prism Context Engine — they define the patterns, conventions, and architectural decisions your AI should follow.

## What Are Rules?

Rules are structured instructions that tell AI assistants how to write code for your project. They can define:

- **Coding patterns** - How to structure components, handle errors, etc.
- **Design system tokens** - Colors, typography, spacing values
- **Architectural decisions** - File organization, naming conventions
- **Tech stack requirements** - Which libraries to use (and avoid)
