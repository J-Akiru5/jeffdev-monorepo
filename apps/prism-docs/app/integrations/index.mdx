## Integration Methods

### MCP (Recommended)

The **Model Context Protocol** provides real-time synchronization:
- Rules update automatically when you change them in the dashboard
- No need to re-export files
- Works across all your projects

### Manual Export

For quick setup or editors without MCP:
- Export `.cursorrules` or `.windsurfrules` from dashboard
- Place the file in your project root
- Re-export when rules change
