# Video Processing

Extract rules and context from your screen recordings automatically.

Prism uses **Mux** for video hosting and transcription, combined with **Azure OpenAI** for intelligent rule extraction.

## How It Works

1. **Upload** a screen recording of your development workflow
2. **Transcribe** - Mux automatically generates accurate transcripts
3. **Extract** - Azure OpenAI analyzes the transcript and identifies patterns
4. **Deploy** - Export rules to your IDE or sync via MCP
