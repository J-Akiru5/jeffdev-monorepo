## Semantic Search

Use natural language to search across your video transcripts and rules. Prism uses Azure OpenAI embeddings to understand the meaning behind your queries, not just keywords.

**Example queries:**
- "How should I handle authentication?"
- "What's the folder structure for components?"
- "Show me the color palette decisions"

## Brand Profiles

Create reusable design system profiles that define:
- **Colors** - Primary, secondary, accent colors with hex values
- **Typography** - Font families, sizes, weights
- **Spacing** - Margin and padding scales
- **Components** - Button styles, card designs, form elements

Export profiles as CSS variables, Tailwind config, or include them in your context rules.

## API Access

Build custom integrations with the Prism API:
- Fetch rules programmatically
- Search transcripts via embedding similarity
- Create and update rules from your own tools
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines
