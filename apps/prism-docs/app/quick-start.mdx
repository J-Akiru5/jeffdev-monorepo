## Your First Rule in 5 Minutes

<Steps>

### Log In to Dashboard

Visit [prism.jeffdev.studio](https://prism.jeffdev.studio) and sign in.

### Create a New Project

1. Click **"+ New Project"** in the sidebar
2. Name your project (e.g., "My Next.js App")
3. Select your primary tech stack

### Create Your First Rule

1. Navigate to **Rules** → **"+ New Rule"**
2. Give it a title: "TypeScript Strict Mode"
3. Add the rule content:

```markdown
## TypeScript Configuration

Always use strict TypeScript:
- Enable `strict: true` in tsconfig.json
- Never use `any` type — use `unknown` if type is truly unknown
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use const assertions for literal types
```

4. Click **"Save Rule"**

### Export to Your IDE

1. Click **"Export"** in the top right
2. Select your IDE format:
   - **Cursor** → Downloads `.cursorrules`
   - **Windsurf** → Downloads `.windsurfrules`
3. Move the file to your project root

### Test It

Open your IDE and ask the AI:

> "Create a function that fetches user data"

The AI should now follow your TypeScript strict mode rule!

## Quick Rule Templates

Don't want to write rules from scratch? Start with templates:

<Cards>
  <Card title="Next.js App Router" href="/rules/templates#nextjs">
    Server components, API routes, file conventions
  </Card>
  <Card title="React Best Practices" href="/rules/templates#react">
    Hooks, component patterns, state management
  </Card>
  <Card title="Design System (JD Studio)" href="/rules/templates#jdstudio">
    Dark mode, glass morphism, Tailwind tokens
  </Card>
  <Card title="Testing Strategy" href="/rules/templates#testing">
    Vitest, Playwright, coverage requirements
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Video-to-Context (Advanced)

Want AI to extract rules from your explanations?

<Steps>

### Record Your Screen

Use any screen recorder (Loom, OBS, QuickTime) to record yourself:
- Explaining your architecture decisions
- Walking through your design system
- Demonstrating component patterns

### Upload to Prism

1. Go to **Video** → **"Upload"**
2. Drop your video file (max 500MB)
3. Wait for processing (2-5 minutes)

### Review Extracted Rules

Prism uses Azure OpenAI to analyze your transcript and generate rules automatically. Review and edit them before saving.

## Connect MCP for Real-Time Sync

For automatic synchronization (no manual exports):

```bash
# Install MCP server
npm install -g @prism/mcp-server

# Configure your IDE (example for Cursor)
# Add to ~/.cursor/mcp.json:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "prism": {
      "command": "prism-mcp",
      "args": ["--api-key", "YOUR_API_KEY"]
    }
  }
}
```
