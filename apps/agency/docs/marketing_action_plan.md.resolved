# Client Acquisition Action Plan

## 🎯 Objective
Establish a steady stream of high-value global leads for JeffDev Web Development Services.

## Phase 1: The "Digital Namecard" (Immediate)
*Goal: Ensure your online presence builds instant trust.*

- [x] **Website Audit**: Ensure your portfolio (jeffdev.studio) loads in <2s and looks premium on mobile. (Done - "Endgame" Design Implemented).
- [ ] **Clutch.co Profile**: 
    - Create a profile on [Clutch.co](https://clutch.co/get-listed).
    - Request reviews from 3 past clients (even small projects count). High ratings here are critical for B2B trust.
- [ ] **LinkedIn Optimization**:
    - Headline: "Enterprise Web Development for High-Growth Startups" (Not "Freelancer").
    - Profile Video: A 30s loom recording of you scrolling through your best site.

## Phase 2: Targeted Outreach (Week 1-2)
*Goal: Contact 50 qualified leads per week.*

### 1. The "Funded Startup" Strategy
Startups that just raised money need to scale fast.
- **Source**: [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/), [Apollo.io](https://apollo.io/) (Free tier), or TechCrunch.
- **Filter**: "Seed Round" or "Series A" + "SaaS" / "Fintech" / "Healthtech".
- **The Pitch**: Don't sell "websites." Sell "Speed to Market."
  > "Hi [Name], saw you just raised your Seed round – congrats! I help SaaS founders ship their MVP 2x faster using a proprietary Next.js engine. Just launched [Link to cool project]. Open to a 5-min demo?"

### 2. The "Agency White-Label" Strategy
Big agencies often turn away work or need overflow help.
- **Action**: Find boutique SEO/Marketing agencies in New York/London/Singapore.
- **Pitch**: "I can be your technical execution partner. You handle design/marketing, I build the pixel-perfect Next.js frontend."

## Phase 3: Content Engine (Ongoing)
*Goal: Inbound leads.*

- **LinkedIn**: Post 2x/week.
    - Post 1: "How we reduced TTI (Time to Interactive) by 40% for a client." (Technical authority).
    - Post 2: "Why we use Next.js 14 for enterprise apps." (Thought leadership).
- **Product Hunt**: Package a small tool or template (e.g., "SaaS Landing Page Boilerplate") and launch it for free visibility.
